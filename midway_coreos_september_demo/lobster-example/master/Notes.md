# Lobste demo - master side

This is added just for reference of the MC demo running.

The lobster master is run outside of VC3 by a user, workers in the VC3 headnode talk to it and VC3 provides the actual resource targets.

To start the master:

1) Install lobster:
http://lobster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
2) Untar mc_gen.tar.gz
3) Adjust stageout paths
4) Run: lobster process mc_gen_small.py
