* Creation of image

Note that the values of RAM, and CPUS are here simply as a minimum. The actual
headnode will probably have larger values.

sudo su
IMAGE_NAME=centos7-vc3.qcow2
ISO=CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso
VM_NAME=centos7-vc3
RAM=512
CPUS=1
DISK=25G
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ${IMAGE_NAME} ${DISK}

virt-install --virt-type kvm --name ${VM_NAME} --ram ${RAM} --vcpus ${CPUS} --disk ${IMAGE_NAME},format=qcow2 --network network=default --graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 --noautoconsole --os-type=linux --os-variant=centos7.0 --location ${ISO} --initrd-inject ${PWD}/headnode-ks.cfg --extra-args "ks=file:/headnode-ks.cfg"

Connect to the running VM with a vnc client (e.g. Remote Desktop Viewer in
Fedora) to 0.0.0.0:5900 and watch the progress. When initial configuration
ends:

virsh start ${VM_NAME}

Connect again with the vnc client to 0.0.0.0:5900

login as root and make sure everything looks fine.
(Note that condor and cvmfs won't work, as we have not configured them yet.)

Then, on a terminal:

virsh shutdown ${VM_NAME}
virt-sysprep -d centos7-vc3  
virsh undefine centos7-vc3

The image is ready at ${IMAGE_NAME}, and can be uploaded to openstack.
